### Fix the Launcher

1. Shrink the launcher. Find a vertical bar and click-and-drag until the
   launcher is the smallest. Note that if you click to low on the vertical bar,
   the mouse will reach the edge of the screen before the bar is the smallest,
   so either try shrinking it again.

2. Remove unused applications. Click and hold an application icon and drag it
   out of the launcher until it says "Remove".
