Title: Keep lists alphabetized

Rule:
- Ensure unordered lists of items (e.g., arrays under `roles:` in Ansible playbooks or bullet lists in Markdown) are kept in case-insensitive alphabetical order.
- When adding, removing, or editing items in such lists, sort them Aâ†’Z.
- Do not reorder lists where order is semantically meaningful (e.g., steps in a procedure, dependency-ordered tasks). If uncertain, ask.

Examples:
- Ansible `roles:` lists should be sorted alphabetically.
- Markdown bullet lists that enumerate tools or packages should be sorted unless an order is explicitly indicated.
